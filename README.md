# docker-3
# Dockerized Spring Petclinic

This repository demonstrates how to run the **Spring Petclinic** application using **Docker**, setting up an isolated network for containers and connecting them to a database.

---

## ðŸš€ Steps and Command Explanations

### 1. Creating a Docker Network

The first step is to create a custom Docker network. This command creates a new, isolated network named `petclinic-net` that allows containers attached to it to communicate with each other using their container names as hostnames. This is a best practice for managing multi-container applications.

```bash
docker network create petclinic-net
```

### 2. Running the Application Containers

Next, two instances of the Spring Petclinic application are launched as Docker containers. The `docker run` command is used with several flags to configure each container.

```bash
# Running the spring1 container
docker run -d \
--name spring1 \
--network petclinic-net \
-p 8081:8080 \
-e SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:mysql://db1:3306/clinic1 \
-e SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=root \
-e SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=root \
spring-petclinic:latest

# Running the spring2 container
docker run -d \
--name spring2 \
--network petclinic-net \
-p 8082:8080 \
-e SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:mysql://db1:3306/clinic1 \
-e SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=root \
-e SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=root \
spring-petclinic:latest
```

- `docker run -d`: Runs the container in **detached mode** (`-d`), meaning it runs in the background and prints the container ID.  
- `--name`: Assigns a **human-readable name** to the container (`spring1` and `spring2`).  
- `--network`: Connects the container to the previously created **`petclinic-net` network**.  
- `-p 8081:8080` & `-p 8082:8080`: This is **port mapping**. It maps a port on the host machine (`8081` or `8082`) to the container's internal port (`8080`), allowing external access to the application.  
- `-e`: Sets **environment variables** (`-e`). These are crucial for configuring the application, such as the `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL`, `USERNAME`, and `PASSWORD` needed to connect to a database.  
- `spring-petclinic:latest`: The name and tag of the **Docker image** to be used for the container.

### 3. Verifying Inter-Container Communication

To prove that the containers can communicate with each other on the shared `petclinic-net`, a **ping test** was conducted.

1. First, `ifconfig` was run inside the `spring2` container (using `docker exec -it <container_id> sh`) to find its internal IP address.  
2. Then, from inside the `spring1` container, the `ping` command was used to test connectivity to the IP address of `spring2`.  

**Result:** The successful `ping` confirms that containers on the same Docker network can communicate with each other seamlessly, which is essential for a microservices architecture.

### 4. Accessing the Applications

Finally, the running applications are accessed from a web browser using the host's IP address (or `localhost`) and the mapped port numbers.

- **Application 1:** `http://localhost:8081`  
- **Application 2:** `http://localhost:8082`  

**Result:** Both URLs correctly display the Spring Petclinic welcome page, proving that the applications are running and accessible.

Run the new db ==> db1 and db2 and they have the same volume 

![16](16.png)

Run docker ps 

![7](7.png)  

Exec db1 

![9](9.png) 

Connect spring1 and spring2 with the db/clinic1 and clinc2 

![10](10.png)  

Create spring3 which have anothe network AND anothe db ---> db3 and have 8083 port

![11](11.png)  

Run docker ps

![12](12.png)  

Trying to connect spring3 with db1 and error happens

![13](13.png)  

connect spring3 with the other network which has db1 and db2 inside it 

![14](14.png) 

And connected sucessfully on port 8083
